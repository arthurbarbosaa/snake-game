This is a simple Snake Game implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The classic Snake Game challenges players to control a snake and eat food, growing longer with each meal while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Features

   - The snake moves continuously.

2. **Objective:**
   - Guide the snake to eat the food represented by a square on the grid.
   - Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, and the score increases.

   - The final score is displayed when the game ends.
